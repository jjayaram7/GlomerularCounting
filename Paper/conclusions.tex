%We proposed an algorithm to measure the number of glomeruli in the entire kidney from contrast-enhanced MRI scans. The proposed method uses a few expert-marked training images to obtain discriminative low-dimensional projections, obtained from non-local sparse coding graphs. For a test image, the number of glomeruli regions can be counted by projecting the image patches onto the low-dimensional space, separating the projected data into two clusters, and performing morphological post-processing. Compared to existing approaches, the algorithm incurs very less computational complexity for test data, and can process the images at a near-real time speed. \textit{Future work??? - processing the images as a time series, 3D, etc.}
